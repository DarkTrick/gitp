GitP aims to simplify the git interface to make it more natual to use (hopefully as natural as  TortoiseSVN, some day).

# Background
Git is a powerful tool, but some actions are cumbersome (like `git push`-ing after creating a new local branch) and really hard to remember (like deleting a remote branch).

# How GitP works
GitP provides easier-to-remember commands and assumes certain defaults (like one origin called *origin* and being the *remote* repository).


# Software Character

The following is a list possible abstract goals a software could have, and a rating how much effort is currently put into it.

- Usability: 100%
- Security: 0% (Do not run as root)
